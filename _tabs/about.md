Hello, I'm Corey Arnold, a passionate self-taught full-stack developer currently working at a small company with international clients. With a relentless drive for self-improvement and a knack for tackling advanced projects, I thrive in the ever-evolving world of technology.

## Professional Background

In my day job, I play a pivotal role in a small company that provides a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for international conference management. As a full-stack developer, I am not only responsible for crafting robust software solutions but I also serve as the sole liaison between our company and the executives of some of our most important clients. This dual role allows me to bridge the technical intricacies of our product with the high-level requirements and expectations of our clients.

I work with a diverse technology stack that includes Coldfusion, JavaScript, React, and Java, ensuring that our conference management platform exceeds the expectations of our clients in delivering seamless and efficient solutions. Additionally, my passion for exploration and innovation has led me to delve into Node.js, React, Dart, Flutter, and Rust in my personal projects, where I continually expand my skillset and apply new insights to our offerings.

## A Lifelong Learner

I'm an intense self-learner, always hungry for knowledge. When diving into a new technology or language, I immerse myself in the depths of documentation and frequently rely on trusted reference books like O'Reilly's JavaScript book. I thrive on the challenge of mastering complex concepts and turning them into practical solutions.

## Passion for Patterns and Efficiency

One of my driving principles is the love for well-crafted patterns and mini-frameworks in my code. I firmly believe that these elements not only save time but also provide a clear and consistent mental model, making code more maintainable and extensible. For me, the beauty of coding lies in the elegance of efficient solutions.

## Classical Music and Opera

Before transitioning to a career in technology, I spent a decade immersed in the world of classical music and opera. My journey in the realm of music has enriched my life in numerous ways and equipped me with a diverse set of skills that I bring to my work as a developer:

- **Multilingualism:** I speak four languages fluently, a skill that has proven invaluable in both my musical and technical pursuits.

- **Versatility in Vocal Performance:** I've sung in ten different languages, captivating audiences with my vocal artistry. Whether it's performing on stage with 45 orchestral players behind me or facing 1200 enthusiastic audience members, I've honed my abilities to connect with diverse audiences.

- **International Performances:** My career as a singer has taken me to foreign countries, where I've had the privilege of collaborating with leading artists and performing for notable personalities.

- **Conducting and Composition:** I've expanded my musical horizons by taking on roles as a conductor and composer. Leading choirs and orchestras through memorable performances and creating my own operas have allowed me to appreciate the intricate harmony of a well-orchestrated ensemble.

My background in classical music has ingrained in me the importance of viewing each element as an integral part of a complex system. Just as every note contributes to the beauty of a symphony, every line of code I write contributes to the functionality and elegance of the systems I build.

This unique blend of experiences has provided me with a holistic perspective, enabling me to work as both a cog and a leader, understanding the value of each component within a larger whole.
